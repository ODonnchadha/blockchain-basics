# Introduction & Definitions
- Overview:

- Definitions:
    1. Blockchain: COnsensus-based secure decentralized public database which stores information immutabaly over a peer-to-peer network.
        - Public or private.
        - Data recorded via consensus-based algorithms.
        - Uses cryptography. 
        - Exists over a peer-to-peer network.
    2. Bitcoin: Decentralized virtual cryptocurrency built on top of Blockchain.
        - Removes the dependency on trusted third-party to exesute the transaction.
        - Executed transactions via peers based upon consensus-based algorithms and recorded in the Blocks by miners.
        - Allows you to execute a transaction without tructing the receiving party in franction(s) of seconds.
    3. Mining: The process of recording the transactions as a block into the Blockchain of that currency.
        - You can earn virtual currency through mining by inversting computational power into it.
        - Answer is that they are asked to solve a very complex computation problem to identify the next block in the Blockchain.
        - Miners use CPU power to identify a nonce (number used only once) through which they can create the digest/signature of the next block in the Blockchanin which is less than the recently added block.
    4. Consensus Algorithm: Computation methodology of resolving conflicts in Blockchain.
    5. Decentralized: Centralized, decentralized (clustered), and distributed.
    6. P2P: And server-based versus peer-to-peer (clients interact with each other.)


# Blockchain Basics
- What is Blockchain and how does it work?
    1. Blockchain is a decentralized ledger tracking digital assets on P2P networks. e.g.: a large book.
        - Blocks in a chain refer to previous blocks, like page numbers in a book.
