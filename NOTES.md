## Introduction & Definitions
- Overview:

- Definitions:
    1. Blockchain: COnsensus-based secure decentralized public database which stores information immutabaly over a peer-to-peer network.
        - Public or private.
        - Data recorded via consensus-based algorithms.
        - Uses cryptography. 
        - Exists over a peer-to-peer network.
    2. Bitcoin: Decentralized virtual cryptocurrency built on top of Blockchain.
        - Removes the dependency on trusted third-party to exesute the transaction.
        - Executed transactions via peers based upon consensus-based algorithms and recorded in the Blocks by miners.
        - Allows you to execute a transaction without tructing the receiving party in franction(s) of seconds.
    3. Mining: The process of recording the transactions as a block into the Blockchain of that currency.
        - You can earn virtual currency through mining by inversting computational power into it.
        - Answer is that they are asked to solve a very complex computation problem to identify the next block in the Blockchain.
        - Miners use CPU power to identify a nonce (number used only once) through which they can create the digest/signature of the next block in the Blockchanin which is less than the recently added block.
    4. Consensus Algorithm: Computation methodology of resolving conflicts in Blockchain.
    5. Decentralized: Centralized, decentralized (clustered), and distributed.
    6. P2P: And server-based versus peer-to-peer (clients interact with each other.)


## Blockchain Basics
- What is Blockchain and how does it work?
    1. Blockchain is a decentralized ledger which tracks digital assets on P2P networks. e.g.: a large book.
        - Blocks in a chain refer to previous blocks, like page numbers in a book.
        - e.g.: Book Analogy: Book = Blockchain. Page = Block. Page entry = Blockchain transaction.
        1. Easy to detect if a page/block has been removed or deleted.
        2. Easy to arrange the pages/blocks and identify suspicious activity.
        3. Impossible to temper a previous entry in the ledger without someone noticing it.
    2. Each block is built on top of the recent block and use its content/signature and nonce.
    3. Building a block and adding it in the blockchain is the task of the miner nodes (optional.)
    4. In public blockchain it is computationally difficult to add a block to prevent attacks.
    5. Miners try to guess a nonce in such a way that if it gets crunched with the most recent block's fingerprint then it will create a new fingerprint which will be less that the last/most recent block in the blokchain.
